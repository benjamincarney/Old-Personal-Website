            <h4>Background</h4>
			<p>

				Hi there! My name is Ben.  <br> <br>
                
                I am currently entering my final year at the University of Michigan and will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in April of 2020.
                Prior to arriving to Ann Arbor, I had never written a single line of code in my entire life. I had always perceived programming and most IT-related work to be some sort of monotonous, obligatory chore
                that a small group of misfortunate souls had to suffer through in order to keep basic technological infrastructure operational. It didn't take long before beginning my first semester at the University of 
                Michigan for my naive assumptions to be completely transformed. 
                <br> <br>
                
                It all started with my first "Hello World" program in EECS 183, an introductory programming course offered through the College of Literature, Science, and Arts here at the University of Michigan.
                I begrudgingly enrolled in the class during my semester in order to satisfy one of many graduation requirements set forth by the College of LSA,
                assuring myself it would be the only interaction I would ever have to face with computer science. As a creative mind interested in music, photography, and writing, I 
                quickly gravitated towards computer science for the unique challenge it offered in allowing me to build my problem solving and critical thinking abilities. I began to view the discipline much differently
                than I had original perceived it, recognizing it more as a series of creative puzzles and riddles that required outside-the-box thinking and less of an endless task list that simply needed to be maintained.
                <br> <br>

                During the summers separating each schoool year, I've had the great fortune to gain real world 
                
                This past summer I worked with the Home Depot on the Device Applications Platform team as a Software Engineer 
                Intern and helped bring a React/Node.js application that will be used to locate thousands of misplaced Android 
                devices throughout 100+ Home Depot retail locations to production.  <br> <br>
            
                Below you will find a downloadable link to my resumé, and well as clickable images that will direct
                you to a few of the projects I've been involved in throughout these past few years.

            <h4>The Rest</h4>
            <p>
                Outside of school I love to write and record music, cook, and exercise (especially when it involves trail running). I'm also a bit of a health nut,
                so I spend quite a bit of my free time researching nutrional science and reading up on the latest studies related to human health.
